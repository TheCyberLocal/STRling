      <strong>The Universal Regular Expression Compiler.</strong><br><br>
      STRling is a next-generation production-grade syntax designed to make Regex readable, maintainable, and robust. It abstracts the cryptic nature of raw regex strings into a clean, object-oriented, and strictly typed interface that compiles to standard PCRE2 (or native) patterns.

## 🚀 Why STRling?

Regular Expressions are powerful but notorious for being "write-only" code. STRling solves this by treating Regex as **Software**, not a string.

-   **🧩 Composability:** Regex strings are hard to merge. STRling lets you build reusable components (e.g., `ip_address`, `email`) and safely compose them into larger patterns without breaking operator precedence or capturing groups.
-   **🛡️ Type Safety:** Catch syntax errors, invalid ranges, and incompatible flags at **compile time** inside your IDE, not at runtime when your app crashes.
-   **🧠 IntelliSense & Autocomplete:** Stop memorizing cryptic codes like `(?<=...)`. Use fluent, self-documenting methods like `simply.lookBehind(...)` with full IDE discovery.
-   **📖 Readability First:** Code is read far more often than it is written. STRling patterns describe _intent_, making them understandable to junior developers and future maintainers instantly.
-   **🌍 Polyglot Engine:** One mental model, 17 languages. Whether you are writing Rust, Python, or TypeScript, the syntax and behavior remain identical.

## 🏗️ Architecture

STRling follows a strict compiler pipeline architecture to ensure consistency across all ecosystems:

1.  **Parse**: `DSL -> AST` (Abstract Syntax Tree)
    -   Converts the human-readable STRling syntax into a structured tree.
2.  **Compile**: `AST -> IR` (Intermediate Representation)
    -   Transforms the AST into a target-agnostic intermediate representation, optimizing structures like literal sequences.
3.  **Emit**: `IR -> Target Regex`
    -   Generates the final, optimized regex string for the specific target engine (e.g., PCRE2, JS, Python `re`).
