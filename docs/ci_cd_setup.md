# CI/CD Pipeline Setup Guide

## Overview

The STRling project uses an automated CI/CD pipeline defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` that handles both continuous integration (testing) and continuous deployment (publishing to PyPI and NPM).

## Pipeline Architecture

### CI Jobs (Continuous Integration)

These jobs run on every push and pull request to `main`, `dev`, and `feature/**` branches:

1. **`test-python`**: Runs the complete Python test suite (473+ tests)
   - Environment: Python 3.12 on Ubuntu
   - Installs dependencies from `bindings/python/requirements.txt`
   - Installs the package in editable mode
   - Executes: `pytest bindings/python/tests/`

2. **`test-javascript`**: Runs the complete JavaScript test suite (473+ tests)
   - Environment: Node.js 20 on Ubuntu
   - Includes Python setup for E2E tests that use the Python CLI
   - Installs dependencies via `npm ci`
   - Executes: `npm test`

### CD Jobs (Continuous Deployment)

These jobs run **only** when:
- The trigger is a `push` to the `main` branch (e.g., a merged PR)
- Both `test-python` AND `test-javascript` jobs have passed successfully

1. **`deploy-python`**: Publishes the Python package to PyPI
   - Builds the package using `python -m build`
   - Publishes using `twine upload`
   - Requires: `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret

2. **`deploy-javascript`**: Publishes the JavaScript package to NPM
   - Builds if necessary (TypeScript compilation)
   - Publishes using `npm publish`
   - Requires: `NPM_TOKEN` secret

## Required GitHub Secrets

Before the deployment jobs can work, you must add these secrets to your repository:

### 1. PYPI_API_TOKEN

**How to create:**
1. Log in to your PyPI account at https://pypi.org
2. Go to Account Settings > API tokens
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Set scope to "Entire account" or limit to the "STRling" project
5. Copy the generated token (starts with `pypi-`)

**How to add to GitHub:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `PYPI_API_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste your PyPI token
6. Click **Add secret**

### 2. NPM_TOKEN

**How to create:**
1. Log in to your NPM account at https://www.npmjs.com
2. Go to Account Settings > Access Tokens
3. Click "Generate New Token"
4. Choose "Automation" type (for CI/CD)
5. Set appropriate permissions (publish access needed)
6. Copy the generated token

**How to add to GitHub:**
1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**
3. Click **New repository secret**
4. Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
5. Value: Paste your NPM token
6. Click **Add secret**

## Workflow Triggers

The pipeline is triggered by:

### Push Events
- **Branches:** `main`, `dev`, `feature/**`
- **Path filters:** Only runs when these paths change:
  - `bindings/**`
  - `spec/**`
  - `tests/**`
  - `.github/workflows/**`

### Pull Request Events
- Same path filters as push events
- Runs CI jobs only (no deployment)

## Branching Strategy

This workflow enforces the following branching model:

1. **`feature/**` branches**: Development work happens here
   - CI runs on every push
   - No deployment occurs

2. **`dev` branch**: Integration and pre-release testing
   - CI runs on every push
   - No deployment occurs

3. **`main` branch**: Production-ready code
   - CI runs on every push
   - **Deployment occurs automatically** after successful tests
   - Only merge to `main` when ready to publish a new version

## Testing the Pipeline

### Test CI Only
To test the CI jobs without triggering deployment:
1. Push to a `feature/*` or `dev` branch
2. Or create a pull request to any branch

### Test Full CI/CD
To test the complete pipeline including deployment:
1. Ensure secrets are configured
2. Merge a PR to `main`
3. Monitor the workflow run in the Actions tab

## Deployment Checklist

Before merging to `main` (which triggers deployment):

- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Version number updated in:
  - [ ] `bindings/python/pyproject.toml`
  - [ ] `bindings/javascript/package.json`
- [ ] Changelog updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] `PYPI_API_TOKEN` secret is configured
- [ ] `NPM_TOKEN` secret is configured

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails: "Invalid credentials"
- **Python:** Verify `PYPI_API_TOKEN` is set correctly and has upload permissions
- **JavaScript:** Verify `NPM_TOKEN` is set correctly and has publish permissions

### Tests Pass Locally But Fail in CI
- Check Python version (CI uses 3.12)
- Check Node.js version (CI uses 20)
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in requirements.txt / package.json

### Deployment Skipped
- Verify the push was to the `main` branch (not a PR)
- Ensure both test jobs passed
- Check the workflow logs for the `if` condition evaluation

### Version Already Published
- PyPI and NPM don't allow re-publishing the same version
- Update version numbers before merging to `main`

## Version Management

Remember to increment versions before merging to `main`:

**Python** (`bindings/python/pyproject.toml`):
```toml
[project]
version = "3.0.0a1"  # Update this
```

**JavaScript** (`bindings/javascript/package.json`):
```json
{
  "version": "3.0.0-alpha",  // Update this
}
```

## Monitoring

Monitor workflow runs:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
2. Click on "STRling CI/CD Pipeline"
3. View recent runs and their status
4. Click on individual runs to see detailed logs for each job

## Security Best Practices

- ✅ Never commit secrets to the repository
- ✅ Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive tokens
- ✅ Regularly rotate API tokens
- ✅ Use scoped tokens (limit to specific packages when possible)
- ✅ Review published packages after deployment
