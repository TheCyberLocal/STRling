# STRling

## üó∫Ô∏è Project Overview

STRling is a next-generation production-grade syntax designed as a user interface for writing powerful regular expressions (RegEx) with an object-oriented approach and instructional error handling. STRling recognizes the cryptic nature of raw regular expression can be challenging and susceptibility to errors, which is why STRling looks and feels nothing like RegEx while maintaining the same power and flexibility. String validation should be simple and enjoyable, not a hassle. Best of all, STRling syntax is built upon the RegEx engine, making it fully compatible with all libraries that accept RegEx along with the traditional RegEx methods built-in to Python.

### üóùÔ∏è Key Features

1. **Beginner Friendly:** You need ZERO knowledge of RegEx jargon to create powerful and clear to read patterns.
2. **Common Templates Built-in:** STRling has predefined templates for commonly used patterns, so forget about even writing our simple syntax for most cases. (phone number, email, url... etc.)
3. **Reliable Logic:** STRling exclusively utilizes built-in python libraries, making it a reliable package.
4. **Instructional Error Handling:** Errors inevitably occur by drafting invalid patterns, so STRling explains to the developer exactly what was done wrong and how to correct it.
5. **Consistent and Readable:** Make your projects clear and consistent by using STRling rather than the individual library string validators that each have their own syntax (Sqlite3, Sequelize, Postgres, WTForms... etc.).

These key features collectively emphasis and fortify the claim that STRling truly is a next-generation production-grade syntax for pattern handling.

### üéØ Project Mission

Our mission is to make RegEx a distant and outdated syntax by abstracting the complexities of RegEx into a clean, readable, and powerful interface. We strive to simplify string operations and ensure that developers can focus on building their applications without the steep learning curve of traditional RegEx. The previous alternative to RegEx was to learn the string validation syntax specific to each user input library, but STRling aims to unify the disparate syntaxes found across various libraries and frameworks into one simple library using only built-in Python packages.

### üíæ Installation

Install STRling via pip:

```sh
pip install STRling
```

## ‚ú® STRling in action!

```python
from STRling import simply as s
import re


# Let's make a phone number pattern for the formats below:
# - (123) 456-7890
# - 123-456-7890
# - 123 456 7890
# - 1234567890

# Separator: either space or hyphen
separator = s.in_chars(' -')

# Optional area code part: 123 even if in parenthesis like (123)
area_code = s.merge( # notice we use merge since we don't want to name the group with parenthesis
    s.may('('),  # Optional opening parenthesis
    s.group('area_code', s.digit(3)), # Exactly 3 digits and named for later reference
    s.may(')')  # Optional closing parenthesis
)

# Central part: 456
central_part = s.group('central_part', s.digit(3))  # Exactly 3 digits and named for later reference

# Last part: 7890
last_part = s.group("last_part", s.digit(4))  # Exactly 4 digits and named for later reference

# Combine all parts into the final phone number pattern
# Notice we don't name the whole pattern since we can already reference it
phone_number_pattern = s.merge(
    area_code,  # Area code part
    s.may(separator),  # Optional separator after area code
    central_part,  # Central 3 digits
    s.may(separator),  # Optional separator after area code
    last_part  # Last part with hyphen and 4 digits
)

# Example usage
# Note: To make a pattern a RegEx string compatible with other engines use `str(pattern)`.
example_text = "(123) 456-7890 and 123-456-7890"
pattern = re.compile(str(phone_number_pattern))  # Notice str(pattern)
matches = pattern.finditer(example_text)

for match in matches:
    print("Full Match:", match.group())
    print("Area Code:", match.group("area_code"))
    print("Central Part:", match.group("central_part"))
    print("Last Part:", match.group("last_part"))
    print()

# Output:
# Full Match: (123) 456-7890
# Area Code: 123
# Central Part: 456
# Last Part: 7890

# Full Match: 123-456-7890
# Area Code: 123
# Central Part: 456
# Last Part: 7890
```

## üìë STRling Documentation

### Don't worry if you can't remember it all!
We have well structured and explanatory docustrings for each function
that allow you to understand exactly how it works by just hovering your mouse.

```python
from STRling import simply as s
import re

####################
# Range Feature
####################

# Most methods allow the `min_rep` and `max_rep` to be passed in directly or after params.
# For example, simply.letter(1, 3) will match 1 to 3 letters.

# But some methods take an unknown number of parameters and can't distinguish the range.
# For example, s.merge(simply.letter(), simply.digit(), 1, 2). <==== INVALID

# However, all methods allow setting the range by externally invoking unless otherwise specified.
# For example, simply.letter()(1, 2) is the same as simply.letter(1, 2).

# This external invocation may seem useless, but it can solve our earlier issue.
# For example, s.merge(simply.letter(), simply.digit())(1, 2). <==== VALID

# Notice for all functions (where repetition is valid) we can invoke the range outside the parameters,
# but it is primarily useful for functions with an unknown number of parameters.

####################
# Custom Literals
####################

# Creates a matching pattern from a regular string
s.lit('$%')  # Matches the literal characters '$' or '%'.

####################
# Character Sets
####################

# Note: Each character set below has a negated counterpart.
# For example, simply.letter() => simply.not_letter()

s.letter()      # Matches any letter (uppercase or lowercase).
s.upper()       # Matches any uppercase letter.
s.lower()       # Matches any lowercase letter.
s.digit()       # Matches any digit.
s.whitespace()  # Matches any whitespace character (space, tab, newline, carriage return, etc.).
s.newline()     # Matches a newline character.
s.tab()         # Matches a tab character.
s.carriage()    # Matches a carriage return character.
s.bound()       # Matches a boundary character.

####################
# Anchors
####################

s.start()  # Matches the start of a line.
# There is no `simply.not_start()` function.
# Instead, use `simply.not_behind(simply.start())`.

s.end()  # Matches the end of a line.
# There is no `simply.not_end()` function.
# Instead, use `simply.not_ahead(simply.end())`.

####################
# Custom Sets
####################

# Note: Each custom set below has a negated counterpart.
# For example, simply.between() => simply.not_between()

# Matches all characters within and including the start and end of a letter or number range.
s.between(0, 9)      # Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
s.between('a', 'z')  # Matches any lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'.
s.between('A', 'Z')  # Matches any uppercase letter from 'A' to 'Z'.

# Matches any provided patterns, but they can't include subpatterns.
s.in_chars(s.letter(), s.digit(), ',.')  # Matches any letter, digit, comma, and period.
# A composite pattern is one consisting of subpatterns (created by constructors and lookarounds).

####################
# Constructors
####################

s.any_of()  # Matches any pattern, including patterns consisting of subpatterns.
# A composite pattern is one consisting of subpatterns (created by constructors and lookarounds).
pattern1 = s.merge(s.digit(3), s.letter(3))  # Matches 3 digits followed by 3 letters.
pattern2 = s.merge(s.letter(3), s.digit(3))  # Matches 3 letters followed by 3 digits.
s.any_of(pattern1, pattern2)  # Matches either pattern1 or pattern2


s.may()  # Optionally matches the provided patterns.
# If a `may` pattern isn't there, it still will match the rest of the patterns.
s.merge(s.letter(), s.may(s.digit()))
# Matches any letter, and includes any digit following the letter.
# In the text, "AB2" the pattern above matches 'A' and 'B2'.


s.merge()  # Combines multiple patterns into one larger pattern.
# You can see this used for the method above.


s.capture()  # Creates a numbered group that can be indexed for extracting part of a match later.
# Capture is used the same as merge.
s.capture(s.letter(), s.digit())

# Captures CANNOT be invoked with a range: s.capture(s.digit(), s.letter())(1, 2) <== INVALID
# Captures CAN be invoked with a number of copies: s.capture(s.digit(), s.letter())(3) <== VALID

three_digit_group = s.capture(s.digit(3))
four_groups_of_three = three_digit_groups(4)

example_text = "Here is a number: 111222333444"
match = re.search(str(four_groups_of_three), example_text)  # Notice str(pattern)

print("Full Match:", match.group())
print("First:", match.group(1))
print("Second:", match.group(2))
print("Third:", match.group(3))
print("Fourth:", match.group(4))

# Output:
# Full Match: 111222333444
# First: 111
# Second: 222
# Third: 333
# Fourth: 444


s.group()  # Creates a named group that can be referenced for extracting part of a match.
# group is used the same as merge and capture but it takes a string name as the first argument.
s.group('my_group', s.letter(), s.digit())

# Unlike merge and capture, groups CANNOT be invoked with a range.
# This is because group names must be unique in a pattern.
# s.group('unique_name', s.digit())(1, 2) <== INVALID

# Groups can easily be referenced from the match by name
# assuming the numbers have been grouped and named properly.
example_text = "Here is a phone number: 123-456-7890."
match = re.search(str(phone_number_pattern), example_text)  # Notice str(pattern)

print("Full Match:", match.group())
print("Area Code:", match.group("area_code"))
print("Central Part:", match.group("central_part"))
print("Last Part:", match.group("last_part"))

# Output:
# Full Match: 123-456-7890
# Area Code: 123
# Central Part: 456
# Last Part: 7890


####################
# Lookarounds
####################

# Note: Each lookaround below has a negated counterpart.
# For example, simply.ahead() => simply.not_ahead()

# These verify a pattern is or isn't ahead or behind
# without capturing it as part of the pattern matched.

s.ahead()  # Only matches the rest of a pattern if the provided pattern is ahead.
# For example, in the text "123ABC", the pattern below matches 3 but not 1 or 2.
s.merge(s.digit(), s.ahead(s.letter()))  # Only matches a digit followed by a letter.


s.behind()  # Only matches the rest of a pattern if the provided pattern is behind.
# For example, in the text "123ABC", the pattern below matches A but not B or C.
s.merge(s.behind(s.digit()), s.letter())  # Only matches a letter preceded by a digit.
