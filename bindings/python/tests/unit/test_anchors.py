Test Design â€” test_anchors.py

## Purpose
This test suite validates the correct parsing of all anchor tokens (^, $, \b, \B, etc.).
It ensures that each anchor is correctly mapped to a corresponding Anchor AST node
with the proper type and that its parsing is unaffected by flags or surrounding
constructs.

## Description
Anchors are zero-width assertions that do not consume characters but instead
match a specific **position** within the input string, such as the start of a
line or a boundary between a word and a space. This suite tests the parser's
ability to correctly identify all supported core and extension anchors and
produce the corresponding `nodes.Anchor` AST object.

## Scope
-   **In scope:**
    -   Parsing of core line anchors (`^`, `$`) and word boundary anchors
        (`\b`, `\B`).
    -   Parsing of non-core, engine-specific absolute anchors (`\A`, `\Z`, `\z`).

    -   The structure and `at` value of the resulting `nodes.Anchor` AST node.

    -   How anchors are parsed when placed at the start, middle, or end of a sequence.

    -   Ensuring the parser's output for `^` and `$` is consistent regardless
        of the multiline (`m`) flag's presence.
-   **Out of scope:**
    -   The runtime *behavioral change* of `^` and `$` when the `m` flag is
        active (this is an emitter/engine concern).
    -   Quantification of anchors.
    -   The behavior of `\b` inside a character class, where it represents a
        backspace literal (covered in `test_char_classes.py`).
